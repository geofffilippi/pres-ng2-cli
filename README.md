# Angular 2 Kickstart

Slides from talk given on May 23, 2016 at the HTML5 Denver Meetup Group.

>Angular 2 is now in Release Candidate stage. We will use the new Angular CLI project to generate a new Angular 2 application. Next, we will take a quick tour through the scaffolded application structure. We will discuss how Angular 2 is bootstrapped and how modules are loaded. We will also show how to use the Angular CLI tool to generate a component and build our application.
